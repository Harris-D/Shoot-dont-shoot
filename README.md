# Shoot-dont-shoot
A repository to store Python code for a cognitive training task created for a Dstl (Ministry of Defence) funded research project (Human and Social Science Research Capability - project HS1.030).

This project examined whether an inhibition training task (based on Ducrocq et al., 2016) was effective at enhancing cognitive function in both armed police and civilian populations. 

Includes code for:
1. An inhibition task that uses a singleton distractor to develop inhibition capability
2. A matched active control task that involes the same visual search element but without the singleton
3. A shoot/don't-shoot task based on Nieuwenhuys et al. 2012
4. A standard version of the Eriksen flanker task
